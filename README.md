## Description/Objective/Goals 
Our Tasks were as follows:
1. We first searched for and tried out different API's 
2. Once we decided on several API's that we were comfortable with using we shaped our website idea around how we could best impliment two of them.
3. We then drew a mock up of our web page using google presentation
4. Next we worked on the HTML/index and CSS files.
5. Once the basic structure of the index page was set up,
6. We then began to work on our JavaScript page.
7. Our next step was clearing up some functionality issues and debugging our page.
8. Our final step is working on the READ ME, final deployment and doing a mock presentation.

## Acceptance Criteria or Milestones
Below is the Requirements for this Project. We believe we have fulfilled all these objectives.

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Presentation Requirements
* Elevator pitch: a one minute description of your application

* Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

* Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

* Demo: Show your stuff!

* Directions for Future Development

* Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository


### APIs you plan to use or Technology
We used 2 different API's for our wesite. To generate our wallpaper we used giphy.com Here is the link! <a href="https://api.giphy.com"> And, to generate our quotes we used the API linked below
<a href="https://geek-jokes.sameerkumar.website/api?">.



### Specific First Tasks - Assigned
Our first task was to figure out what we wanted to do. We came up with many ideas that sounded great on paper but how to impliment those ideas might be too complex. So we then went on to actually look up diffent Web API's play around with them, see how they worked and by doing that we came up with the idea for our website. Susan came up with our name right away. 


## Roles for Contributors
- We all threw around ideas and tried different methods, to get the features of our page to work. However we did assign certain individual tasks.

-Asia and Susan worked on the HTML and CSS files.
-Rashan and Rick worked on the JavaScript file.
